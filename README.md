# Tic-Tac-Toe Project
This version of Tic-Tac-Toe is a single page application that allows the user(s)
to play a responsive game in the browser. Users create a profile that allows
history, such as games played, to be stored in an API and returned to the user
on request.

## Planning Story
This was the first project that I have built, and it was certainly a learning
experience. Going into the week I told myself that I was going to spend ample
time planning and that I wouldn't make the mistake of looking at the project
as whole, but instead I would break it up into small problems that were
manageable. I did not do a very good job sticking to this plan. The first day
overwhelmed me, and I was not very productive. I wasted a lot of time trying to
figure out how to start the project, and it was not until I used the suggested
schedule that I was able to modularize the project and begin progression. I
then treated the schedule as if it was a checklist and began working my way
systematically down the list. I also used the issue queue more and more as the
week went on. I realized that often times a little bit of help or expertise
lended was enough to look at stubborn problems differently and figure out a way
to solve them.

On future projects I will focus on making a schedule for myself and using it to
organize my time and workflow more effectively. Overall this project was a great
learning experience.
